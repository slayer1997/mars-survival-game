# Mars Survival Game

A first-person survival game set on Mars built with Three.js. Experience the harsh Martian environment as you manage resources, build a habitat, and explore the red planet.

## Game Concept

Mars Survival is an immersive, tense first-person experience where players feel the isolation and hostility of Mars while experiencing moments of discovery and achievement as they establish a foothold on the red planet. The game balances stress and reward, creating a compelling loop of risk and accomplishment.

## Features

- **Resource Management**: Monitor and manage oxygen, water, food, and power
- **Martian Terrain**: Explore procedurally generated Martian landscape
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Experience temperature variations and lighting changes
- **Base Building**: Expand your habitat with modular components
- **Environmental Hazards**: Navigate dust storms, radiation, and extreme temperatures
- **First-Person Controls**: Immersive movement and interaction

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
3. Click on the game window to enable first-person controls
4. Use the following controls:
   - **WASD**: Move
   - **Mouse**: Look around
   - **Space**: Jump
   - **Shift**: Run (uses more oxygen)
   - **E**: Interact with objects

## Survival Tips

- **Oxygen Management**: Your oxygen depletes over time. Return to your habitat to refill.
- **Temperature**: Temperatures drop drastically at night. Seek shelter.
- **Resources**: Explore to find water and food sources.
- **Energy Conservation**: Running depletes oxygen faster. Walk when possible.

## Technical Details
